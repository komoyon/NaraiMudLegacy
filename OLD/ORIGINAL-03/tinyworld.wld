Shiriff Training Grounds~
   The sounds of mock battle and feigned death cries fill your ears.  Every
which way you turn you see halfling trainees at the prime of their youth.  A
wizened old battle instructor meets your gaze and asks if he may be of 
service.  The only exit lies to the west.

bread fill your lungs.  Rumor has it that the pipeweed bread sold here can
restore vitality.  You look around but find no one to take your order.  
You then peep over the counter and discover a friendly grocer who is too 
short to be seen over the counter.  The only exit is to the north.

Check Point~
This street leads into the city of loftwick.  Shops and homes have been
carved from the stone surrounding the street.  The whole place looks to 
be in horridshape. The devices that once provided perpetual light here 
are gone, leaving this place in complete darkness, probably for some 
time now.

This was once the shop of an accomplished metal smith.  Various items lay

However, the only thing you can see is an outline drawn on the wall of a

There are literally hundreds of books lying here. They are surprisingly

Loftwick was not only the founder of this city but was also the brother
of Redferne the Grand Knight of Paladins. Loftwick left Midgaard after
a bitter dispute with Redferne. He used vile magics in pursuit of
immortality. Through his magics he met a race called the GITHYANKI that 
offered to help him in exchange for a haven on this plane that they 
could raid Midgaard from. Loftwick agreed but he didn't count on the 
Githyanki turning his city into a realm of the living dead and a truly 
EVIL place.

that for Karn to grant Loftwicks request, Loftwick had to murder his own wife
to show dedication to Karn.

The dark woods~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were drug off in two directions,
south and east.

cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes, is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.

shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are

Lost in the Mist~
You try to peer through the mist......You see nothing. It swirls about you,
covering you in a damp sheen. There is no sound, all light is eagerly devoured
by the mist. You feel totally and hopelessly lost.

You stumble through the marsh here. The swamp seems to have swallowed you up
and denied you exit. This mist is your jailor. You cannot tell where you are.

This chair is really a masterpiece.  A chair where one can sit as comfortably

The Turning Point~

from seeing far in any direction save north, where a broad lane leads off into
the distance; and west, where the same lane continues towards what looks like
a fairly large city. The muted sounds of city commotion reach your ears from a
distance; stray dogs barking, children crying, and street salesmen shouting.
You can "call" taxi to Process' house here.

The city hall~
     This is the main reception area of Thalos' city hall. The walls have
been charred and scored massively and debris is spread from wall to wall.
A large gaping hole in the west wall allows you to see out to one of
the city's side streets. Obviously noone will be seeing you through today. 
Hallways lead south and east.

withered plants and broken pieces of furniture make this place anything
but fancy, though. The only thing remaining intact here is a large
glass cabinet. A long hallway leads west back to the reception area and
an ivy-covered archway leads south into a private courtyard.

The private gardens and courtyard of Thalos~
     What a shame that this mass destruction also touched this once
beautiful place. The temple's garden path has nothing on this garden.
Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
thrown through walls. A large marble fountain in the center of the
courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
beauty. Above stands the reminants of one of the watchtowers. Archways 
north and west lead back into the city hall.

a city here seem much more reasonable). Closer inspection of the water

Unfortunately, it succumed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desicrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tounge.

the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the

Ascent to Mt Olympus~
The rocky path slowly disappears from sigh at you enter a huge bank of
fog.  You stop for a minute and peer down the huge mountain in which you
have been climbing.  The fog bank which you ignored, seems to be the
clouds over Graecia.  What a sight!  You can see the entire lands of
Graecia at your feet.  The trail continues to spiral upwards to a
massive gate, and the trail disappears into the clouds below.

You have entered the home of Zeus, ruler of all the gods in Graecia.

This is the room of Hera, wife of Zeus.  There seem to be no walls in
this room, only open scenes of several events.  All of them are focussed
on beautiful women.  In each of the scenes, the woman is being carefully
trailed and watched by a shadowy figure.  Another scene catches your eye
and it suddenly glows red.  Hera immediately looks at the scene and
begins to tremble with anger.  The scene depicts Zeus and a young woman
talking by a beautiful pond.  Suddenly Hera screams, turns towards you
and looks as if she is going to take vengeance on YOU!

thousands of grape trees here, in perfect form.  There is a huge grape
press that is carefully monitored by a group of slaves.  To your right
you hear singing, and you see nymphs crushing grapes and making wine.
The wine is then poured in huge kegs which flow into a huge basin in the
middle of the chamber.  Sitting on the edge of the basin is Dionysus the
Graecian god of wine.  He nods and gets another glass from the basin.

crowded around hundreds of tables.  You can barely see the tables, by

training area~
   곳곳에 이름모를 풀들이 돋아 있고,간간히 나무도 보이는 
   이 넓은 지역이 바로 오나라 병사들의 훈련장입니다.
   넒은 초원과 얕으막한 언덕들 사이 저 멀리로 지평선이 늘어져
   있고, 오나라 병사들이 곳곳에서 무리를 지어 땀을 흘리며 
   열심히 무술연마를 하고 있습니다.
