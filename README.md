Narai Mud Legacy
======================

This is source repository of Narai Mud.
Narai is very old Korean text MUD, circa 1995

It is in lineage of KIT-MUD, which is precursor of
modern Korean on-line RPG game, and direct heir of EVE MUD.

It preserves tradition and history of old Korean text mud in the year 1995.
It has easy-going, anything-goes style of Korean on-line games.
Think of Grand Theft Auto of 1995!
So nickname of Narai was aka kkagpae mud, outlaw bully.

But to make it run on modern Unix like FreeBSD or Linux,
I revised and modernized the original source of circa year 2000.

But its play is nearly identical to old, legacy Narai.
Zone, map, balance, commands are same as 25 years ago.
It is well reserved history of old ancestor of modern online game.

## Vrsions
There are few versions of the source.
VERSION COMMITTED NOW is Legacy 2003 version.

### Legacy 2003
The oldest one is version used around year 2000â€“2003.
It was run on MS Windows with CygWin system.
To run it, you need CygWin DLL's,
**"cygwin1.dll"** and **"cygcrypt-0.dll"**.

But original Narai was run on Sun 3 Workstation,
(Motorola 68030 CPU, old SunOS based on BSD 4.3 before Solaris OS)
it can be easily ported back to BSD Unix varieties.

### Legacy 2010

This version is nearly identical to 2003 version,
with little updated and bug fixed.
It can run on today's FreeBSD Unix OS,
but it suffers from old age and rough youth days.
For Linux machine, little Makefile editing is needed,
due to difference between GNU make and BSD make syntax.
### Modern Legacy 2019

To preserve history and legacy of Korean text MUD and Narai,
I revised it, based on Legacy 2010 version, for modern Unix
including Linux and Free BSD and did little code clean up and bug fix.
It preserves same user expectation of 1995 era
but improved for modern environment like Linux, gcc, GNU make,
UTF-8 code and 64 bit CPU.

This is on-going effort and work in progress, in alpha stage.

### Classic 1998

This is other fork of original Narai around year 1998.
The source code was clean up and many improvements were added.
It added may new features and improved quality of mud life,
but preserves similar user experience of original Sun 3 days.

But text MUD itself was already out of date by then,
and eclipsed by modern graphical PC/console online games.
Not many people played it, so it is urban legend.

## Current Narai

You can play the Legacy 2010 version and 2019 version
with telnet on narai.mynetgear.com port 5001 and 5002.
