Shiriff Training Grounds~
   The sounds of mock battle and feigned death cries fill your ears.  Every
which way you turn you see halfling trainees at the prime of their youth.  A
wizened old battle instructor meets your gaze and asks if he may be of 
service.  The only exit lies to the west.

bread fill your lungs.  Rumor has it that the pipeweed bread sold here can
restore vitality.  You look around but find no one to take your order.  
You then peep over the counter and discover a friendly grocer who is too 
short to be seen over the counter.  The only exit is to the north.

Bank of Loftwick~
This was once the bank of loftwick, where citizens stored thier fortunes.
Against the far wall, behind the teller windows, you can vaguely make out
the outlines of the vault door. The vault has been torn apart and is filled 
with rubble. Oddly it looks as if something tore it's way OUT!?!?!

Chapel~
This chapel has been untouched by time.  Everything in this chapel is in 
excellent condition.  All the pews are polished to a gleem.  To the far end
you can just make out an altar.  There are numerous candles along the walls,
all of which are lit and burning.  You sense a presence of Peace in this 
room. You can barely make out the sounds of chanting here.

Hokar Ave~
This is the end of the street.  To the west is the entrance to a grand arena.
Looking to the west you notice a heavy metal gate blocking your entrance west.
There are deep gouges from something passing this way many times.  A stench
like that of a sewer assaults your nostrils.

Arena Entrance~
This is the entrance to a very large arena.  You can from here see that this
building is different from all the others you have seen. As you get a little
closer you can see that it is because the outside is covered with claw marks
large and small from the ground to the roof.

Concession Stand~
This is what appears to have been the concession stand.  A sign still hangs 
from rusty hinges.  All around this room are candy wrappers, as if something
has been snacking between meals....  All candies have been eaten save for
a Mars bar with a bite taken out of it.  The bite appears to have been spit
back on the ground in disgust.

Arena Grounds~
This section of the arena has been converted into a nursery for a dragon, 
you think.  The size of the nest suggests a HUGE dragon would live here.
However, the only thing you can see is an outline drawn on the wall of a
a powerful and huge dragon.  Many bodies lay strewn about, half eaten.
Wait.  The shadow moved!  It IS the dragon!

There are literally hundreds of books lying here. They are surprisingly
in good condition. After a brief search of the texts you learn that
Loftwick was not only the founder of this city but was also the brother
of Redferne the Grand Knight of Paladins. Loftwick left Midgaard after
a bitter dispute with Redferne. He used vile magics in pursuit of
immortality. Through his magics he met a race called the GITHYANKI that 
offered to help him in exchange for a haven on this plane that they 
could raid Midgaard from. Loftwick agreed but he didn't count on the 
Githyanki turning his city into a realm of the living dead and a truly 
EVIL place.

in only moments ago.  You sense a great anger as it becomes apparent 
that for Karn to grant Loftwicks request, Loftwick had to murder his own wife
to show dedication to Karn.

   문이 열려 있지 않으면 그 방향으로는 안나타납니다.또한 방중에는 어두운방이
   있습니다.그럴때는 그 방의 이름은 나타나지 않고 단지 그 방향에 방이 있다는
   것만 알려주죠.   ( help exits라고 쳐보세요. exit라고 쳐보시고요.)
 *.당신이 무엇을 입거나 벗거나 할때는 어떤 명령을 사용 할까요?
   바로 wear와 remove명령입니다.예를 들어 hat을 입으려 한다면 wear hat

    어려운 monster를 죽이기 위해 서로 협동을 해서 공격을 하는것, 이것이
    머드의 큰 매력중의 하나랍니다.그럼 그룹은 어떻게 만들까요?
    우선 같이 뜻이 통하는 사람끼리 모여서 leader를 정합니다.
    그리고는 모든 사람이 follow leader_name을 합니다.그럼 leader는
    group member_name을 해서 그룹을 만들게 합니다.이렇게 하면 리더가 다니

  *.그룹을 결성하고 같이 다니면서 한 monster를 죽였을때는 그 monster의 경험

    assist name(여기서 이름은 플레이어 야만 됩니다.)을 하면 그사람의 싸움에
    당신도 참가 할수가 있게 됩니다.이것을 그룹할때 사용하면 일단 리더가

   그 비율은 자신의 레벨을 깨지는 비율로 생각 하시면 됩니다.
   만약 20레벨에서 자신이 죽었다면 입고 있던 아이템중 약 20%가 깨지게 됩니다.
   깨지지 않은 나머지 아이템들은 자신의 시체(corpse)에 남겨지게 되므로 만약
   당신이 그런 경우를 당하게 되면 꼭 자신이 죽은 장소로 가서 나머지 아이템들

sign~
  A long time ago, there was a world. It was a land of myth. There were gods, 
 kings, princesses, knights, dragons and many other things. And one day, the 
 end of world had come. Entire world was in burn and returned to void.
 Long time had passed. And, at last, something appeared from void. It's a new 
 world! A new world appeared from void. And new history began.
 First, gods appeared and created lands, creatures, and things. Then people 
 made a temple for gods, and named it as Temple of Midgaard.
 Time passed.
 Creatures lived their lives. Old ones died and new ones were born.
 And now, the story of MUD begins.

The Turning Point~

from seeing far in any direction save north, where a broad lane leads off into
the distance; and west, where the same lane continues towards what looks like
a fairly large city. The muted sounds of city commotion reach your ears from a
distance; stray dogs barking, children crying, and street salesmen shouting.

    This home is practically the only one around that is still standing.
Except for the massive hole in the east wall, evrything else looks

The Temple of Thalos~
    You stand within one of the most holy places in the realm. This
stunning domed temple once housed the city's worshipers en masse. 
Unfortunately, it succumed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desicrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tounge. 
     Wind gusts through the four archways and howls and screams can be
heard from all parts of the city.

drawn in every spot available for such. In the middle of the map you can
spot a large town with the name 'MIDGAARD' written over it. The rest is
mountains, woods, plains and water.

midgaard town city~
You see a small speck with woods on the west from it, plains to the east
from it and mountains to the north from it. To the south from it you can
see a thin trail lead to a large castle. Finally you notice a rather large
river pour in from the east and go through Midgaard in the middle.

These two chair are exactly alike one another. They look incredibly

These windows are really BIG! They reach from about 20 inches above the
floor to approximately 10 inches under the ceiling. If you try and
"look out", you might see what might lie beyond these windows.

The clouds muster and form the ground on which this entire building is set.
Through the thinnest of the clouds you can just make out MIDGAARD with all
it's magnificent activity.

river~
You see a large and winding river cut through the landscape, starting at an
enormous inland lake, it seeps through Midgaard and finally ends up in the
Grand Sea on the West-coast of the land.

The Artifact room of Naris~
This is gloomy and dark room with only a faint light radiating from the
walls. A bunch of funny-looking items fill the center of the room. There are
no furniture here what-so-ever. The only way out seems to be west, through
the low steel door.

The Northern end of the hall~
You are standing in the northern end of the huge hall. This part is under
the grand wooden staircase so the light seems a little less bright here,
but this doesn't bother your sight at all. To the north lies the kitchen.
To the south lies the Southern end of the hall. To the east there is a huge
metal door. To the west there is a large aspenwood door.

The Chain where it's too windy~
Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there's no way of leaving down 
from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a
totally impossible task. The ascend is the only way ahead for you.
Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT

As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

     Sticky, sticky, sticky!  The ground is cluttered with leaves, decayed
remains of webbed crickets, beetle, rats, dogs (?), and even humans.
You begin to wonder about what lies ahead.  The air is damp here,

have been spray painted on the walls and floor. Nailed to the ceiling are
an assortement of skeletons. All seem to have been dead for a very long
time. All surfaces of the room are covered with dried blood and dust.

fall from your body.

Wall of Fire~
This large room is cut in into sections by small walls of fire. The walls
to move slowly changing the layout of the room. As you examine the room
further you notice various posts around the room to which people are
chained to. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Thier deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...
To the north you see a hall of fire.

anything you have, since business is slow. Not many people visit
Hell. The store is filled with worthless junk. Piles of aluminum balls,
and bottle cap collections fill the corners of the room. Thing of
every description lie about the store.
To the east you see the Mall from Hell.

Graecia at your feet.  The trail continues to spiral upwards to a
massive gate, and the trail disappears into the clouds below.

beauty.  Her room is furnished with mirror-like walls, ceiling, and
floor.  There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of flowers here, one of
each type has taken root in the mirror floor.  There are also urns
neatly stacked along the northern wall.  An erotic aroma issues from
tiny holes holes in the urns, and your body tingles as the aroma
penetrates your senses.

Hera's Vengeance Room~
This is the room of Hera, wife of Zeus.  There seem to be no walls in
this room, only open scenes of several events.  All of them are focussed
on beautiful women.  In each of the scenes, the woman is being carefully
trailed and watched by a shadowy figure.  Another scene catches your eye
and it suddenly glows red.  Hera immediately looks at the scene and
begins to tremble with anger.  The scene depicts Zeus and a young woman
talking by a beautiful pond.  Suddenly Hera screams, turns towards you
and looks as if she is going to take vengeance on YOU!

press that is carefully monitored by a group of slaves.  To your right
you hear singing, and you see nymphs crushing grapes and making wine.
The wine is then poured in huge kegs which flow into a huge basin in the
middle of the chamber.  Sitting on the edge of the basin is Dionysus the
Graecian god of wine.  He nods and gets another glass from the basin.

from the blast staggers you!  The shopkeeper seems to pay no heed to this.
The door to the back room opens and an older man, wearing a pointed hat, whose

famous mage that Rome has ever known.  Workbenches line the walls and are
covered with various test tubes, beakers, petri dishes and crucibles and there
is an odor in here that can best be described as a combination of old sweat
socks and burning tires.  The only exit is back through the door through which
you came.  In the middle of the room, you see a pile of ashes that looks like
it once was a body and Froboz is busy making adjustments on a new type of
magic wand .... possibly the one responsible for the explosion a few minutes
ago.  He removes a jeweler's loupe from his eye as he turns around.  "How in
the name of Merlin did you get in here??!!" he asks.  "Oh, nevermind!  Since
you are here, you can serve as witnesses to the final test of the new mage's
spell:  'ectowatt'."  With this he makes a magical gesture and the Paladin
Knight appears.  Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his direction and
what happens next is incredible!  The Paladin is enveloped in what appears to
be a small, well contained, thermonuclear explosion.  When the smoke clears
you can see that the Paladin and all of equipment has been reduced to a large
pile of flaming cinders.  Froboz throws his head back and cackles with insane
glee.  "Now, my young friends, what can I do for you?" he asks.

   수많은 선반들마다 갖가지의 물품들이 올려져 있습니다,
   많은 창문들은 모두 빗살모양의 나무들로 가리워져 있어
   통풍과 함께 햇빛이 바로 들이치는것을 막아 줍니다.
   창고지기가 선반사이로 이리저리 움직이며 물건을 확인하는것이
   보입니다.당신은 그에겐 달갑지 않은 방문객일텐데,볼일 없으시면
   나가시는것이..........

   병사들이 그들의 가족과 자신의 안녕을 기도하러 자주 온다고 합니다.
