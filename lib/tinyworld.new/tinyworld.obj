  This note seems of utmost importance, as it has the stamp of the
    Queen on it!  It says:
	To Anyone,
	I have lost my birth control pills, and I will reward anyone who
	finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
	You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
	since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
	of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
	examine the area CAREFULLY since the dust is very thick there.
	But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
	The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.
  PS When you find them, tell the Gods, and he will reward your hard
     work.  You must have all the keys necessary to obtain it, also.

   There are some fun things in here, and if you can't figure them out,
   DO NOT ask a god.  There is a quest involved within here, and your
   first hint is that a dwarf in the barracks is your first clue.  He
   is not willing to share in the prize, so you may have to kill him
   for it.  When you complete the quest, you will be richly rewarded!
   Don't think that it is easy, because it is NOT.  Contact Depeche
   when you have finished the quest, or leave a message on the board.
   PS If you find any bugs, please report them.

sword~
The blade of the sword is a full meter long, and straight as an arrow, with
lightly fluted sides. Both edges keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp. Perfection like this could of only been forged by a god. The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade
                      Yet he will in the end no triumph see.

sign~
   Rome was written by Onivel of JediMUD in the spring of 1992.  It was
originally debugged and tested on Renaissance DikuMUD and then ported to
CircleMUD and finally JediMUD.  I would like to sincerely thank the following
people who gave invaluable help in the design and construction of this area:

 Rasmussen of CircleMUD  -- for idea to write Rome in the first place and for
			    advice with coding Roman god routines.

 Destiny of Apocalypse   -- for encouragement, proofreading, help in refining
                            the area concept and allowing me to put my first 
			    area on her MUD.

 Miranda, Romulus, Ikee, and all the others who assisted with balance, bugs
 and typo eradication, or just had a good time here.

 Thanks.
   -Onivel
