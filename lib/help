EXPERIENCE XP

>> INFORMATION
Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

  * When you are in group, group's gaining XP is calculated like this.
      mob's exp
    + (number of "equivalent" level players in same room - 1) * mob's half exp 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    = total exp

      total exp
    / number of group member
    / highest level in group
    ------------------------
    = shared exp

      shared exp
    * one's level
    -------------
    = exp gained

    "equivalent" level means difference with highest level is smaller than 5. 

We encourage killing of other players, but the choice is yours.

GROUP

>> COMMAND

USAGE :
	 group [player]

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

EXAMPLE :
	Ares and Process wishes to group with Dragon.
	Process> follow ares
	Dragon> follow ares
	(Ares should be following no one but himself)
	Ares> group ares
	Ares> group process
	Ares> group dragon

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.
