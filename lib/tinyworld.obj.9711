  This note seems of utmost importance, as it has the stamp of the
    Queen on it!  It says:
	To Anyone,
	I have lost my birth control pills, and I will reward anyone who
	finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
	You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
	since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
	of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
	examine the area CAREFULLY since the dust is very thick there.
	But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
	The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.
  PS When you find them, tell the Gods, and he will reward your hard
     work.  You must have all the keys necessary to obtain it, also.

   There are some fun things in here, and if you can't figure them out,
   DO NOT ask a god.  There is a quest involved within here, and your
   first hint is that a dwarf in the barracks is your first clue.  He
   is not willing to share in the prize, so you may have to kill him
   for it.  When you complete the quest, you will be richly rewarded!
   Don't think that it is easy, because it is NOT.  Contact Depeche
   when you have finished the quest, or leave a message on the board.
   PS If you find any bugs, please report them.

    성스러운 이 물은 석가모니의 땀방울도 그리스도의 핏방울도
    아닙니다. 단지 이 물은 전설로 내려오는 고대 IMPLE의 체내
    에서 흘러나온 가장 자연스러운 물이랍니다. 당신이 이 물을
    마신다면 당신은 삶의 의미를 다시 파악하고 마치 성인이 된
    듯한 마음을 가지도록 한다는 말이 있습니다.(usage:quaff)
