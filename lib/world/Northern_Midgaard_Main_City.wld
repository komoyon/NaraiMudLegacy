The Library~
     A plush carpet muffles your footsteps as you tread past shelf after
shelf of musty tomes, compendiums, scrolls and sheafs of various unearthed
arcana.  Faint magical wards glow in midair, preventing the exercise of 
magic or loud speech in this place of stored lore.

Audience of the Grand Archmage~
     You stand in a high-vaulted chamber.  Light streams in from open
balconies.  Majestic tapestries cascade from ceiling to floor along the 
surrounding walls.  You are truly awed by the display.  The only other 
furnishings include a rug and a rickety, wooden throne.
