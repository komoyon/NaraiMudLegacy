Hera's Vengeance Room~
This is the room of Hera, wife of Zeus.  There seem to be no walls in
this room, only open scenes of several events.  All of them are focussed
on beautiful women.  In each of the scenes, the woman is being carefully
trailed and watched by a shadowy figure.  Another scene catches your eye
and it suddenly glows red.  Hera immediately looks at the scene and
begins to tremble with anger.  The scene depicts Zeus and a young woman
talking by a beautiful pond.  Suddenly Hera screams, turns towards you
and looks as if she is going to take vengeance on YOU!
