 Hi..
 I've checked rent fee...
 There're somethings I want to tell...
 ... Mainly, the price is cheap for zizon items and expensive for low levels..
especially for below 10... or 5...
 I'm not sure yet... I must think more...
 .. Right now, my thought is this... the curve of price must be exponential.
 ... Some item price must be lowered.... and some raised...
 ... Well, ... if low levels use only items that they can get themselves..there
is not so much problems.. but ... higher levels give some items to low levels.
usually... I'm not sure.. I must check how much money low levels can get with
basic equipment...-like KIT-MUD school items and long sword...-
 ... And another one is this... Maybe, mainly the price is depend on hr and dr.
So, even high AC... if low hr dr.. price is low.. right?
 Well, as you said, there'll be changes of item status, so differ from present
status... The list will be right. But, according to present status, I can't
understand... some of item prices... How is a pair of bracers better than
brassard of Hydra? And.. is Iron sleeves best? Why is Platinum Bracelet so
cheap? Cheapest Bracelet is Platinum... Well, and Bloody Pickaxe? How can it
be more expensive than Yuseong or Bombard? Though it has good dice... ???
Oh, Noble's Longsword.. Is it better that Dragon Tooth Knife or Samurai Sword?
No. Noble's Longsword just has 1D8 and hr+2 dr+2... Dragon Tooth Knife has 4D5
and hr+2 dr+2... Two handed sword is 3342? More expensive than Bombard? It has
1D12 and hr-2 dr+3... Though it has dr+3... its dice is just 1D12 and ...easier
to get than Bombard Sword...
 ... I don't know... I'll think more.. And... :) in fact such items -Noble's
Longsword, Two handed sword and so on- are seldom used... I've never seen
someone who uses those weapon... So, price is no problem...
 But... like Brassard of Hydra.. and others... there needs some changes....
I think.....
 ... Please let me know, by what you decide price... and .. if there's changes
of item status.... Let me know, please... Oh.. it's not so necessary.....
Don't mind...
 Well, I'll think about it more... Later...
 Bye. Have a good time...
