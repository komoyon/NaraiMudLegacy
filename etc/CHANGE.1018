    Warrior Hand Dice 올려..  50d50 가능 
    Request 문제 단군도 가능하게 하구 대충 한 10개 정도 Quest
    날라가게 하겠다

    Metaphysician과 Quest 선물의 변화 by Illusion

    Metaphysician에서 Hit, Mana, Move point들을 살때 단군이 아니라면 
      15000 이상은 살수없습니다.
    Quest 선물의 변화:  단군은 request ticket이 나오지 않습니다.
    meta ticket은 단군일 경우에만 나옵니다.

    39레벨까지의 선물에서 meta ticket이 사라지는 대신
    armor, weapon이 나올 확률이 좀 더 높아졌습니다.


90/08/20 by Gem :
	quest.c
		give_gift_for_quest has changed.

	spec_procs2.c

version 2.90.2
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
    fight.c: 
        Uncommented some assert()'s for debug.  

******  This code was not activated. More jobs and tests.....

	eval_exp(): NEW : NOT ACTIVATED
	    More elaborate exp gain calculation.
	    Evaluate how hard to kill the mob for exp point.
	    Approximately exp = sqrt( dam * hit * AC * 100/40 );
		where dam = (hand_dice + damroll) * (level/6) for warrior.
	    Very careful not to overflow or underflow. (loss of precision)
	    Need more refinement , test and balancing job.

	isqrt(): NEW: NOT ACTIVATED 
	    integer squre root for eval_exp()

	NOT ACTIVATED
	gold amount scale GOLDSCALE set to 15
	gold gained = mob's gold + level(mob)^2 * GOLDSCALE;
	See group_gain() & damage() 

******	Return to OLD narai exp system.  Fri Sep 26 14:28:54 KST 1997
******  To activate above codes, #undef OLD_NARAI_EXP in fight.c

        EVAL_GOLD(): NEW : macro def to calculate killing prize gold.

	adjust_gain(): NEW
	    Shows earned exp and gold point when PC player killed char.
	    Do exp, gold and alignment manipulation. 
	    Check PK and set pk_num.
	    Player can't get exp/gold from cloned or re-animated mob.  

	damage():
	    Use more elaborate exp calc based on difficulty of mob. 
	    May need some scale adjustment.
	    Player can't get exp from reraised victim

	TO DO: reraise/cloned/re-aninated mob check should be unified.
		( rerasied victim should lose at least gold to killer ??? *)

	group_gain(): 
	    Assertion commented out.
		This assertion fails sometimes. Why? Killer fled? Find out!  
	    high_level calculation not used. comment out.
	    Money splitting rule changed in favor of large grouping. (1/n)
		In fact, old rule is *aginst* large group. (1/(n*n)) 
	    Add pk_num even in case of group PK.
	
	do_hit():
	    You can't hit your group member.
	    Forbid hitting member of same guild.
	    But permit fighting mob of same guild OR same group.

	die() :
	    Changed PC player death penalty :
	    You will lose about 1/10 - 1/2 of exp.
	    200 *level^3 -> max(min(300*lev^3,exp/2) exp /10)

    act.movement.c
	do_follow():
	    Cleaned up confusing code for clarity.
	    Stops group when you start following someone.

	    If not, resign leadership, and ungroup.
	
        do_open(), do_close(), do_lock(), do_unlock(), do_pick():
	    This applies to all door related  routines:
	    These routine searchs door in inventory first , room next,
	    exits last.  This is wrong. If you have item like 'door key',
	    'west gate key' in your inventory or room, These are confused.
	    Search door name first!
	    door name = "door gate grate trapdoor hatch window . room hall"

	 search_door(): NEW
	    Similar to find_door(), it checks if there is ANY door of that 
	    name. Direction ignored.  Used in all door related functions.

	new : max (lev-7)*(lev-6)* 4K   lv20 = [182K,782K], lv40 = [1.1M,4.5M]
	
	    Quest ring, necklace, light now become more useful,
	    They will have armor affected (APPLY_ARMOR) insted of HITROLL

    quild_command.c:
	Taxi cab fare raised 10 times.:
	to KAIST 20000, to PROCESS 30000. hmmm .. seems more realistic.

    utils.h : added #include <assert.h>

Tue Sep 23 15:19:53 KST 1997

    act.wizard.c
	do_echo(): God's echo will be heard by all PC player in the world.
	do_chat():
	    "chat" with no arg is same as "chat /last"
	    Little code clean up ( use do_lastchat() in act.comm.c )
	do_set():
	    When "set char keyword" fail, show list of keywords.

	    It's meaningless to change passworod of active player.
	    Set player passwd disabled temporary.
	    Set password bug fixed.
	    	1) Now passord encrypted. 
	    	2) save victim's char, not ch's		 	
	    TO_DO: set passwd of non-playing char.

	do_demote()
	    Preserve player ability stats (str,int,wis,dex,con) on demote.

	do_stat() 
	    MSTAT/PSTAT/STAT wiz command will search mob/player 
	    in current zone before seaching whole world for mob/player.

    handler.c
	get_char_wiz(): 
	    get_specific_vis() is rewritten as get_char_wiz()
	    3rd arg (type) is bit vector, not bool.
	    This function is called solely by do_stat(). (in act.wizard.c)
	    Added seach for zone before seach all world.

	isname(): Rewite isname() , code clean up.
	    isname() matches multiple word string.
	    i.e. "xxx yyy" will match to "abc xxx yyy zzz "  
	    digit, '-', '_' char is valid char for name.

	get_char_room_vis()
	    'self' is generic name refering yourself. ( cast 'heal' self )

    interpreter.c
	one_argument():
	    one_argument() will take quoted args as single arg.
	    Surround multiple words with quotation marks. ( 'like this' )
	    Now, you can resolve confusing name like president as
	    "cast 'relocate' 'bookkeeper exp'" (single quotation included )

	    Rewrote indexed version to pointer version for clarity.
	    Find the first word of string excluding fill word ( "at", "in" ),
	    Copy it to first_arg. If non-fill word don't exist. fill word will.
	    Returns pointer to next unlooked char ( blank + following words )

    spec_procs.c
	npc_steal() - Suggestions by Tido.
	    Sleeping/dying mob or mob who can't see victim (blind, invisible
	    dark room & no light, etc ) should not steal victim's gold.
	    Charmed mob can't steal its master's gold.
	    Charmed mob can't leave beside master after stealing others gold.  

v2.90.3

utils.h: 
    Added external function prototypes of all func()'s in utility.c

    INCREASE_SKILL() macros mas changed to function call.
	It is too big for macro. Use function version for space efficency.  
	The function version is in utility.c. See FYI: there for details.

	void increase_skilled( struct char_data *ch, struct char_data *victim,
	                      int sk_no, int mul, int add );
	    NOTE: probability = 1/( skilled(ch, sk_no) * mul + add )

	#define INCREASE_SKILLED(ch, victim, sk_no) \
		increase_skilled(ch, victim, sk_no, 2, 99 )

    #define STRHAN( a, b, ch ): NEW MACRO: 
	Select english or korean message string according to ch's 
	locale selection. Useful for sprintf(). 

    #define ASSERT(test) : NEW MACRO: 
    	Similar to assert(), but don't abort().
	just print log() where ASSERT() failed.

utility.c

    monetary() NEW
	Format number in financial format like "-98,765,432".
	Returns pointer to recycled internal static char buffer.

    monetary() NEW

        without rounding. like "-98,760,000".

    find_end() NEW
	Find last last line terminator (CR-LF/LF-CR) in string.  
	Used to append string as single line. 

    increase_skilled() NEW
	Function version of INCREASE_SKILLED() macro.
	It checks victim is pet to prevent skill drill by robot play in petshop.
	And removed guild check in PK. It is pointless.
	NOTE: probability = 1/( skilled(ch, sk_no) * mul + add )

act.comm.c:

    do_tell():
	"!" as listener name means telling to whom you told or replyed
	    last time. This applies to telling to mob, too.
	    ex) tell ! Hmm, Please help me, firend..

	If lisner can't hear you because of sleeping.
	    Show lisner name. (He can't hear you. -> Hydra can't hear you.)
	    And notify to sleeping PC player to wake up.

	Distinguish PC player tell from Shopkeeper tell.
	    Fred Wilson tells you 'No magic here - kid!'.
	    Cookie tells YOU 'Hello, I am in MID. C'mon'.  

    do_write()
	Ignore pen. It has no useful meaning.
	Code checking pen in inventory or hold item is commented out.  
	TO DO: modify help on 'write' and borad/mailbox description for this.
	
act.informative.c

    Removed : list_obj_char()   Added list_equips_buf()
    Added symbolic defintion of mode arg of list_obj_buf(), show_obj_buf().
    Currently, LOOK_INV is same as LOOK_CONT. mode 4 not used.  
    
    argument_split_2(): SUBSTITUTED with NEW look_arguemnt(). 

    int look_argument(char *argument, char *arg1 ) NEW!
	Parse argument for look command as argument_split_2() does.
	Search for direction word ( north, ..., up, in, at )
	Copy first non-diection argument in arg1.
	Returns direction keyword index or -1 if none. 

    show_obj_char() is SUBSTITUTED with NEW show_obj_to_buf().

    int show_obj_to_buf(struct obj_data *object, struct char_data *ch,
		 int mode, char *buffer)
	It sees one and only one object, not objects in container.
	It store output to buffer, not sending to char
	It checks visibility of obj to char and returns it. 

	It give more specific info about items. 
	Especially for ITEM_WEAPON, you will be infomed weapon type.
	TO DO : /* NOTE: Needs more description for all 22 type */ 

	Shortens descr. about humming or glow to fit in single line if possible.  
    list_obj_to_char()
	Now, it send output to char through page_string() for long output.
	    It will mitigate problem that disconnecting player due to 
	    long and rapid output when too many object is in single room.
	Can list contents of bag in bag. (for one level only, not recursively)

    show_char_to_char():
	OLD show_char_to_char() is divided into two functions.
	NEW show_char_to_char() (OLD mode 0), look_char_to_char() (OLD mode 1) 
	NEW show_char_to_char() is used when you look room.

	Detect evil mark append to end of long char description in same line.
	Detect invisible mark is not changed. (prepended to beginning)
	
	Sanctuary and Love affected look description merged in singe line.
	    to prevent affection description stacked on and on.
	Indef. noun (He/She) is used for char name in affection description.

    ex)  Musashi is here, dancing with his samurai sword. (Red Aura)
	 He glows with a bright light! and is EXICTED with glorious feeling!!

    look_char_to_char() NEW
	Second half of OLD show_char_to_char()
	It is used when you look 'at' some specific character.
	It will send output through page_string().
	Reduced peek success rate for low level thief.
	    number(0,20) < level  -> number(0,40) =< level
	It prints equipment list using list_equips_buf().

    OLD show_char_to_char() mode 2 is same as list_obj_To_char()
	it is not used in anywhere. So removed.  

    OLD list_char_to_char() : Removed. function merged to list_all_in_room().

    list_all_in_room()
	list_obj_to_char() + OLD list_char_to_char()
	Show all characters and all object in room. 
	Used when you enter a room or look room.  

    do_look()
	Unused variable removed: buf[], arg2[], found.
	Move static char keywords[] definition to early in souce file.
	keyword serach is relegated to look_argument().

	In case of 'look at obj' and found no object, it serachs extra 
	    descriptions and print it. After that it will show_obj_to_char()
	    the [item with the extra description]. This is correct behavior.
	    Old behavior is try to show object fail to find in vein.

	Show extra description *without* using page_string().
	Use list_all_in_room() 
	    insted of list_obj_to_char() and list_char_to_char();

    do_report()
	Report to me, too.
	
    do_exit()
	Show virtual room number guessed by some probability.
	To make Gaussian distribution, perturbate repeatedly.
	   loop  lev/4 + 2 times
	       room number += number(-12+lev/4, 12-lev/4); 

    do_score()
	More compact and distictive score display format.
	Generate only one of hangul contents or english contents.
	Use financial format (like 1,234 ) for exp and gold.

    do_spell()
	Appended each of spell/skill line with player's current spell/skill
	    learned, skilled stat of that skill/spell. 
	If the skill/spell is not applicable to that class/level, mark it. 
	
	BUG FIX: Now, partial match is OK for listing indivisual spell.

    do_equipment()
	Calls list_equips_buf() and print it. No change of functionality.

    list_equips_buf(): NEW
	print to buffer all equipment which char is wearing or using.
	Called by do_equipment and look_char_to_char().
	
    do_police()
	Log more info about socket descriptor, not just hexa address.
	    address, desc number, host, input buffer.

magic2.c : 
    spell_far_look()
	Use list_all_in_room() to look room.

comm.c

    close_socket()
	Before close() socket descriptor, send out pending output in queue 
	    and flush queue.

    send_To_char_han()
	If korean message is null, send english message instead. 

    is_korean() 
	Hopelessly out of date. Useless. Comment out.
    more_than_20()
	Also obsolete and impotent. Useless. Comment out.

    record_player_number()
	Now it is meningless to distinguish foreign/domestic players.
	    Counting/printing of Korean/abroad number commented out.  
	Removed CR char from log string. log is not TTY.  

db.c
    Use abort() instead of exit() for abnormal exit.

    reset_time()
	Set begining_of_time to 0. It was 650336715
	Now, time is about The 31st Day of the Month of the Sun, Year 1022.
	    On Real World, Mon Oct  6 21:40:33 KST 1997
 
    store_to_char(), char_to_store()
	They will restore, save 'jail_time' variable in lib/players file.

    init_char()
	Newly created PC player is wimpy by default. flee at 1/10 of max hit.
	This is for novice player forgetting to set wimpy before first death.

    do_rent()
	BUG FIX: If do_rent() is called by check_idling(), don't return to
	    main menu state. Otherwise it will cause SEGV error
	    when idle player is kicked out. 
    
handler.c

    extract_char()
	BUG FIX: casuses SEGV error when check_idle() calls do_rent().
	    ch->affeted list traversal is wrong.
	    *af is free()'d in affect_remove(). So af->next is invalid pointer.
	    Save af->next in af_next and use it for traversal.

    get_char_room_vis()
	'leader' is generic name refering player you follow. ( 'assist leader' )
	    This applies only when you are following PC쨛layer leader,
	    can see him/her, and in same room. ( grouping not needed ) 

    get_char_vis()
	Search char of that name in zone before search all over the world.
	Its implipication is not known.

    create_money()
	Due to hyper inflation in MUD, less than 1K coins are not considered
	    much, and not worth counting.
	    So I scaled up money description by 100 fold.

act.others.c

    do_wimpy()
	BUG FIX : It will check null argument. 
		It crashed on "wimpy on" command line.
	Set wimpy zero to flee at 1/10 of maximum hit. (Old default)
	    Then, wimpy value will be propotional to max hit gain.
	Se wimpy value will make unwimpy player wimpy. 

    do_practice()
	It will print spell number on each entry.
	Little duplicated code clean up. 

spec_procs.c

    guild()
	Skill/spell linsting in Practice Room with prac command will list 
	    two skill/spell in each line.
	Added spell number for cross refernce.
	BUG FIX: page_string() will keep internal copy. Otherwise it will
	    mixed up with other players output in guild room.

    npc_steal()
	assert() is wrong. commnet out.
	Check ch-> master is not null before comparing with victim
	    or checking ch->master->in_room.

fight.c

    adjust_gain()
	It will print exp and gold you get in financial format with
	    only 4 most siginficant digits. (like 1,234,000 ) 

    damage_message()
	Currently all damage messages are breif only. 
	    So message strings for verbose messages are commented out.
	    static struct dam_weapon_type dam_weapons[] 
	    static struct dam_weapon_type han_weapons[]	

	Added static struct dam_weapon_type you_dam_weapons[] 
	    When Player is in group fighting and English mode,
	    prepend '*' char to 'You', 'you', 'YOU' word to help they be 
	    easily recognized among long and rapid damage messages scroll.
	    ex) "*YOU ---==<< V A C U U M >>==--- Queen Sharon."
		 "Queen Sharon -miss- *you."

	Brief message has no string to replace (no #W macro ).
	    Omit replace_string() with attack_hit_text[] for efficency.  
	No need to distinguish message ndex type in english message of
		singular/plural attack_hit_text[]. Not used.

    replace_string()
	Not used any more. Commented out.

    damage()
	Mobile don't need wishing flee message ( ".. wish .. stop BLEEDING.." )
	If wimpyness is zero for PC player, flee at 1/10 of max hit.  

    hit()
	Cleric class can do more damage with CRUSH type weapon 
	   in addition to BLUDGEON type weapon. 
	Changed serial 'if' clause to more efficent 'swith' clause.
	Dubious statement of shadow figure advantage clarified.


act.wizard.c

    do_banish()
	Now, wizard can specify jail term for banish()'ed PC player. 
	Optional second argument is hours the player have to serve in jail.
	It may be fractional number. (minimum 0.02) 
	Default jail term is 24 hours if no 2nd arg is given.  
	After jail term expires, player will be forgiven and trans'ed to MID.
	All these punishment and forgive is logged. Don't abuse it.  

	ex) banish badboy 1.5 ( put him in jail for 1 hour and 30 min.) 

spec_procs2.c

    perhaps(): added more newbie tips.

    jail_room(): 
	It was jale_room(): spelling correction.
	Added code for freeing player whose jail term expired.
	When player is freed, simple move will trans him to MID.
	Shouting /chatting prohibited.
	Additional command permited for safe_house() is acknowledged.
	
    bank()
	Show balance in account in financial format.

    totem() 
	Use list_all_in_room() to look room.

spec_assign.c 
    assign_rooms()
	room 6999 (jail for banished player) is changed to jail_room() type.

interpreter.c:

    argument_interpreter()
	Too confusing and redundant. Simlified with pair of one_argument().
	CAVEATS: If second word is fill word, it will be discarded.
	    Ex. "kill at mob1 with knife" -> arg1 = "mob", arg2 = "knife".
	    If no word after fill word,("kill at") arg1 = "at" arg2 = "".

	BUG FIX: OLD argument_interpreter() will fall in infinite loop on 
	    command line like "kill at" (no word after fill word).  
	    OLD argument_interpreter() is commented out.

    commando()
	minimum positions of LOOK and CAST command are lowered to
	   POSITION_STUNNED. do_look() and do_cast() does their own 
	    minimum position check and emits rejection message.

    nanny():
	Added state CON_ENTER:  Entering game state. 
	Additional pause time after CON_SLCT / menu select 1
	    for read welcome messgae, mail check, which was scrolled away.  

	When player punished by Wizard enters games, he will return to jail 
	    if jail term not expired and not forgiven.
	Check banished player's jail_time and send him to jail, again.
	If jail term expired, release him from jail.
		
	Even if RETURN_TO_QUIT name is defined, don't save player's room.
	    In MENU state player's room number is -1 (NOWHERE)

	act("$n has reconnected.", ... ) don't need CR+LF.

modify.c
    string_add()
	Use post_board_char(), wrapper proc of post_board().
	This proc don't take current board argument.
	No need of board structure related declerations. Commneted out.

    page_string()
	Little optimization to avoid memory allocation/deallocation.
	If string is less than 20 lines long, don't paging. Just send out.  
	Reduced page length from 22 lines/page to 21 lines/page.
    
	Even if RETURN_TO_QUIT name is defined, don't save player's room.
            In EXDSCR state, player's room number is -1 (NOWHERE) 
    
board.c
    show_board()
	Neatly aligned board message listing.		    

    write_board()
       If first arg of write is not "board", it is taken as part of title. 

    post_board()

quest.c

    struct zone_data[] :
	Zone name "The Jale" -> "The Police Jail"

    quest_room() : 
	BUG FIX: I left out arg of  gain_gold(ch,gold)
	BUG FIX: APPLY_ARMOR should be negative for better AC.
		 substitue HITROLL, not DAMROLL

shop.c 
	
    shopkeeper() on cmd = 56 /* Buy */
	If first arg is number, buy that many items in single trade.
	    ex) "buy 10 solar"

    shopping_buy() returned no value. 
	Now, it will return -1 on failed transaction. 0 on success.

        'pointed' last time. target is unset when target died.

    affect_remove()
        Warnning! Don't use af->next for ch->affected list traversal.
        *af is free()'d in affect_remove().

	Added some aliases for frequently used commands. 
	See aliases[], and aliased[] for complete list.  

	Command 'emote' abbreviation ',' changed to '~'
	ex) ~ scratchs floor. = Cookie scratches floor.  

	Log some commands accoding to log level (logcommand flag).
	    0 : No log.

spec_procs.c
    mayor() Need SEARCH and DESTROY BUG!!
	BUG FIX: SEGV Error at  switch[index] statement.
	1. Maybe index >= sizeof(path[]) or path has invalid value. .
	2. static int index, static char *path was inadvertantely overwritten
	   by some unknow bug. I suspected spurious buffer overrun in 
	   buf[] of how_good() or holder[] of fname(). But They are innocent.
        3. index or path[] were randomly and intermittentely overwritten 
           by someone.  I suspect some stray pointer refernce thru invalid 
           affect pointer. But I can't zero in the spoiler and kill it. 
           Plz watch closely affect_remove() and it's callers. 
           Esp. affect_update().

	But he is not understanding the codes and my intension.
	Forgiven (unbanished) player can walk way from jail to mid
	    by simply moving.(n,e,w,s)  No need to trans him to MID.
	When non-banished player is in jail, he (mis-)teleported there.
	That deserves some kind of punishment. Don't free him.
